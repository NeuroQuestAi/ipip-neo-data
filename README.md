The International Personality Item Pool [(IPIP)](https://ipip.ori.org/) is a public domain collection of items for use in personality tests. It is managed by the [Oregon Research Institute](https://www.ori.org/).

This repository contains the datasets for the **120** and **300** versions of the [(IPIP)](https://ipip.ori.org/), where the scores were calculated based on users' responses 
using the [Five-Factor-E](https://github.com/NeuroQuestAi/five-factor-e) library.

The original datasets were provided by Professor **Dr. John A. Johnson** and can be accessed at the link [https://osf.io/tbmh5/](https://osf.io/tbmh5/).

### How to use 🚀

To use the project, simply install [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) on your machine. Then, run the commands below:

```shell
cd ipip-neo-data; poetry shell; poetry update
```

Now run:

```shell
jupyter lab --no-browser
```
