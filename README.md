The International Personality Item Pool [(IPIP)](https://ipip.ori.org/) is a public domain collection of items for use in personality tests. It is managed by the [Oregon Research Institute](https://www.ori.org/).

This repository contains the datasets for the 120 and 300 versions of the IPIP, where the scores were calculated based on users' responses using the Five-Factor-E library.

The original datasets were provided by Professor Dr. Johnson and can be accessed at the link https://osf.io/tbmh5/.
